# Kleen Website

WARNING: WEBSITE V0 STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT - code generation coming soon!!

A static website documenting **kleen** hosted on github pages
[here](https://amilner42.github.io/kleen). The website serves multiple purposes,
it both provides a tutorial as well as providing some sexy code generation
features.

### Tech Stack

This static website is coded in Elm, because Elm is beautiful :) The code is
compiled into javascript and put in the `docs/` folder, which is where github
looks for the static assets.


### Contributing

Love Elm? Love Kleen? Want to start helping out, feel free to ping me, make
issues, send PRs, anything you want really. Do keep in mind, as per usual,
simplicity is extremely important to me so I make reject your ideas if I feel
they add too much complexity.


### Bugs

The best thing to do is fix it and send me a PR :) If not, just make an issue
and I'll take a look as soon as I can!
